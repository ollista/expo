<i>If you want to take from your life the most valuable for yourself, it has to be for the good of the higher; for yourself it is enough to leave just a little. To work on yourself for the good of others is a smart way to receive the best from life for yourself.</i><br><b>Gurdjieff</b>

<i>Get out of your homes, get out of your villages, get out of your cities, leave your birthplace, your clans, go out in Allah's way and free your heart from anything other than Allah and His Messenger, and only then you will enter into the kingdom of God.</i><br><br>
The spirit of man - is nothing. Almost nothing. There are no qualities except one - directional. It's like a compass needle points to the place. That is the place which belongs to and where it wants to go ... But it cannot be understood, it is necessary to feel or become that. And we have to answer for this question: who are you? And while you're answering, you will remove all that is not you, and that prevents you from feeling the direction of the Spirit. And the Spirit is you indeed.</div>
