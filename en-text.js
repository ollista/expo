'I will not give answers to your questions. Absolute and universal answers do not exist. Everything in this world is relative, and the right answers and knowledge depend on the situation and the spiritual reality in man.

Truth - is a condition that is learned through tasting, and not the information and affirmation. And even if some statements, information, and belief is the truth, then it again lies in the proper implementation of this formal knowledge and accentuation rather than the very belief in itself. <a href="https://m.vk.com/wall84219586_5129">more</a>...'],
